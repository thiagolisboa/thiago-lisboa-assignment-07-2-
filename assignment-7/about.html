        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p> I am Thiago Lisboa, and architectural design senior student at Parsons School of Design. Originally from São Paulo – Brazil – where I have lived and experienced the country during my entire life, before coming to college. However, before coming to NY, the plan was to become a pianist in Paris. I was admitted to the Ecole Normale de Musique de Paris, but when I supposed to go, I realized that music would not give me the creative opportunities I have always liked to have and so I changed paths to architecture. I would just be playing pieces that other people wrote, while in architecture I would be able to explore different approaches to how buildings could be designed and built.
        Besides architecture I am also interested in painting and music. Every time I go to Brazil I have paintings commissioned and I also learn new piano pieces. Those two arts have always been part of my life and I always find time for them during the busy architecture student life. Another aspect that influences my work is food, believe me or not. Depending on the kind of food that I had for the last meal or the food experience that I had that week, or even that month will have an influence in my work.
